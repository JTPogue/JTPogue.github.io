            Hello, my name is Jason. I'm application developer looking for his first job
            in the industry. If you ask me for my interests, you'll get a different answer each day of the week. I love the act of creating and my interest shifts between rendering, user interface, 3d modeling, and several other fields. Hopefully as time goes on, I can populate this website with the things I love and strive to create.
